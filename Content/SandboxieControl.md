# Sandboxie Control

### Overview

Sandboxie Control is the classic graphical agent to Sandboxie, and can control most aspects of Sandboxie. It is important to note that many of the features since mid 2020 are not available using the classic client. These are some of the things that you can do with it:

* Start and stop programs under the supervision of Sandboxie
* View files inside the sandbox
* Recover desired files out of the sandbox
* Delete the contents of sandboxes, purging all undesired files
* Create, remove and configure sandboxes

* * *

### Visibility

Sandboxie Control is primarily a mechanism to run other programs, not an interactive tool. You will typically hide the main window of Sandboxie Control, and the program will only be visible as a tray icon in your system notification area, typically at the lower-right corner of the screen:

(Note the yellow Sandboxie Control icon near the clock.)

To toggle the hidden state, double-click the tray icon, or right-click it and select the _Show Window_ or _Hide Window_ commands. (See [Tray Icon Menu](TrayIconMenu.md).) Additionally, you can hide the window by clicking the close button (X) at the upper-right corner of the window.

To quit Sandboxie Control and remove its tray icon from the system notification area, right-click the tray icon and select _Exit_.
